ðŸ˜€ Hello there! I am Xinyu, currently a post-doctoral researcher @ [CAR](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/car) where I work with [Prof. Qi Wu](http://www.qi-wu.me/) and [Dr. Bohan Zhuang](https://bohanzhuang.github.io/) on multi-modal efficiency related topics. Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [The University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/) under the supervision of [Prof. Chunhua Shen](https://cshen.github.io/).
