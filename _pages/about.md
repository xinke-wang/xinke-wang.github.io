ðŸ˜€ Hello there! I am Xinyu, currently a post-doctoral researcher @ [CAR](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/car) where I work with [Prof. Qi Wu](http://www.qi-wu.me/) on vision and language related topics. Prior to that, I was a Ph.D. student @ [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/) supervised by [Prof. Chunhua Shen](https://cshen.github.io/).
